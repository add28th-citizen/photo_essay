  <h1>1st Road Trip</h1>
  <p class="meta">April 2025</p>

  <p>
    With the thrill of a new journey, we set out on our first road trip in the van. Not just to see new places,
    but to remember what it feels like when days are shaped by light, distance, and curiosity
    instead of schedules. The van was packed "lightly", expectations even were of fun and adventure.

  <p>
    Early miles are always tentative. Did we turn off the stove? We listen more closely to sounds, notice small changes,
    wonder if you forgot something important. (No wait, all is good... <b>George is here!</b>) But with each mile, confidence grows quietly,
    not because everything is perfect, but because you realize you can adapt.

    Travel has a way of stripping life down to essentials. Water, fuel, food, and time.
    Everything else becomes optional. The reward is a kind of mental spaciousness that’s
    hard to find when life is over-optimized.

  <p>
    Somewhere along the way, the journey stopped feeling like movement and started feeling
    like presence. Conversations slowed. Thoughts stretched out. The road stopped asking
    where we were going and simply invited us to keep going.

  <p>
    By the end, it was clear this trip wasn’t about distance covered or places checked off.
    It was about learning how little is actually required to feel grounded — a shared direction,
    a sense of motion, and the freedom to stop when something quietly asks for your attention. Still lots to learn, but a good start.
